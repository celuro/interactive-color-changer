# Interactive Color Changer

This project focuses on using core DOM document methods such as appendChild(), createElement() and addEventListener(). It allows users to dynamically change the background of the website by clicking a button for an interactive experience. These colors are chosen from a predefined list of four colors: magenta, aqua, light pink and light blue.

# Features

## Simple UI
Written steps to ensure the user understands that clicking the button will change the background color.

## Predefined Color List
I picked visually appealing colors that contrast well against the dark grey text. 

## Dynamic Background
Instantly transforms the background color.
